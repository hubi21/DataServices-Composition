# DataServices-Composition
A quality-based service composition approach to identify the relevant data services that can be used to populate the missing information. In doing so, we adapted local-as-view data integration techniques. Moreover, we elaborated a knapsack-based algorithm to select the services that yield good quality results without exceeding a given budget (time and monetary cost).
